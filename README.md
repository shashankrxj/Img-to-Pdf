# Img-to-Pdf
This a project in which Images get converted into Pdf being developed by me using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Opening page would be look like this:

![1](https://github.com/shashankrxj/Img-to-Pdf/assets/140810017/b57776e2-a9fd-419a-9f25-c2566fc660bc)

You rather drag you image to inner container or click choose file button.

Second page would show the picture you have selected and give u option too delete the selected image or add more image then click on right most button written as "DOWNLOAD AS PDF" and your pdf would be downloaded.
