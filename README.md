# Img-to-Pdf
This is a project in which Images get converted into Pdf being developed by me using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Opening page would be look like this:

![1](https://github.com/shashankrxj/Img-to-Pdf/assets/140810017/b57776e2-a9fd-419a-9f25-c2566fc660bc)

You rather drag and drop you image to inner container or click "choose file" button.

Second page would shows the picture you have selected and give you option to delete the selected image or add more image after that click on right top most button written as "DOWNLOAD AS PDF" in red and your pdf would be downloaded.
